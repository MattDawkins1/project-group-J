# Agenda 10th March 2023

## 1. Github
* Does the Group Repo have to be private? Currently public and not able to change to private.
* Lecturers usernames to add as contributors.

## 2. Advice on modelling and whether we have time to implement it. Preliminary thoughts:
* Forecast demand every 5 minutes.
* Try a range of models (point forecasts and/or density forecasts).
* Models include:
* Regression (OLS, bayesian?)
* Autoregressive models (ARMA, GARCH, HAR etc)
* Neural networks (incl. bayesian)
* Ensemble models/weighted ensembles of the above

## 3. Advice on data. Preliminary thoughts:
* If we can't find granular enough data, can we use the single location temps only or would there be value in using less granular data
