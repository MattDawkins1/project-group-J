## Other Notes & Information
After understanding Week 1 Consultation Requirements it was decided that the original meeting with Gustavo (Monday 6th March 2023 7-8pm) would not be beneficial as we needed more time to complete 1 activities and attempt Assessment 1A - Group Project Plan. 
Team meeting on 9/3 to begin work on group project plan, and work through GitHub issues.
